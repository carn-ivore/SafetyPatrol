To add pull-to-refresh functionality to your GitHub Pages site, add the JavaScript code I've provided above. Here's where to paste it:

Where to paste: Add this code at the end of your JavaScript section, right before the closing </script> tag. If you have your JavaScript in a separate file, add it at the end of that file.
Important notes:

This code creates a visual indicator that appears when users start pulling down.
It only triggers when users are at the top of the page.
When released after pulling down far enough, it will show your loading indicator and refresh the data.


Customization needed:

The function refreshWeatherData() at the end should call your existing function that fetches weather data. If you don't have such a function, it will simply reload the entire page.
You might need to adjust the styling of the refresh indicator to match your site's design.


Testing:

This will only work on touch devices (mobile phones, tablets).
You can test it in Chrome's device emulation mode (F12 > Toggle Device Toolbar).



If your site has a specific function that fetches the weather data without reloading the page, replace the location.reload() line with a call to that function to make the refresh more seamless.
